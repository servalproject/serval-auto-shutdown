# Serval Auto Shutdown 2.0 #

The Serval Auto Shutdown application will automatically shutdown a phone after a specified time period and optionally playing an alert sound. The team at the Serval Project has found this to be useful as members of the team regularly travel with a number of phones in a bag. When knocked a phone can automatically turn on unnecessarily draining the battery. 

*Please Note* that this application required root access in order to shutdown the phone

The original Auto Shutdown application was based on an idea that our lead researcher and project co-founder [Dr Paul Gardner-Stephen](http://http://servalpaul.blogspot.com.au/) had was implemented by [Romain Bochet](https://github.com/rbochet). 

This new version is a complete rewrite and includes functionality missing in the previous version.
